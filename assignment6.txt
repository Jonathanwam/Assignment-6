Assignment	6	(in	two	parts)
Part	1
Write	a	program	in	C	utilizing	the	gnuplot	library		that	performs	the	following	task	
(in	Linux):
1) creates	an	X11	plotter	window	on	the	display	screen	of	some	suitable	size	
(say	750	by	750	pixels)	with	a	black	backround.
2) Reads	the	data	from	file	/encs_share/cs/class/cs261/planet.dat
(make	a local	copy for	yourself).
3) Plots	the	first	5	bodies	listed	in	the	file	at	their	initial	coordinates.		Each	body	
should	be	plotted	as	a	filled	circle	of	the	color	indicated	in	the	file.		Inflate	the	
diameter	of	the	planets	such	that	they	are	adequately	visible	on	the	screen.
4) After	displaying	the	bodies	on	the	screen	for	10	seconds	(see	the	man	page	
for	sleep())	remove	the	bodies from	the	screen (replot	them	in	black),	
leaving	the	screen	black.
Demonstrate	your	program	for	me	in	the	lab	by 5:00PM, Friday,	March	11th.



Part	2
Using	Euler’s	method,	simulate	the	motion	of	the	bodies	(at	least	5)	for	10,000	days.		
You	will	need	to	select	a	suitable	time	increment.		If	you	wish,	you	may	want	to	
improve	your	numerical	solution	method	by	employing	Huen’s	method,	as	
described	in	the	slides.
Repeatedly	plot	the	bodies	at	a	suitable	interval	such	that	their	behavior	is	
animated.		Plotting	the	bodies	at	a	new	location	will	necessitate	“erasing”	them	from	
their	previous	position.
Instrument	your	program	to	detect	how	long	(in	days)	each	body	requires	to	
complete	one	orbit.			Print	out	the	lengths	of	the	orbits.
Demonstrate	your	program,	and	provide	a	hard	copy	of	it,	by	the	5:00PM on	Friday,	
March 25th.
